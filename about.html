                <p> I’m Guna Satya Murari, a highly motivated cybersecurity enthusiast and programming expert with a keen interest in ethical hacking and digital security. My journey began with exploring the foundations of programming in languages like Python, C, and Java, and has evolved into creating robust, secure systems that protect against modern threats. </p><br> <p> As someone passionate about solving complex problems, I’ve undertaken projects like steganography tools, keyloggers, and password crackers (designed responsibly for ethical purposes), showcasing my technical skills and commitment to advancing digital security. My strong grasp of concepts like data structures, algorithms, computer networks, and operating systems provides a solid foundation for addressing real-world challenges. </p><br> <p> During my internship with IBM SkillsBuild, I had the privilege of honing my expertise under expert mentorship, further strengthening my hands-on experience in data analysis and cybersecurity. From building efficient penetration testing tools to exploring innovative applications of Python, I continuously strive to expand my knowledge and create impactful solutions. </p><br> <p> For me, cybersecurity is not just a career—it's a mission. I believe in the transformative power of technology to protect and empower businesses, individuals, and institutions. I am always eager to collaborate on innovative projects and contribute to a secure and connected world. </p><br>
